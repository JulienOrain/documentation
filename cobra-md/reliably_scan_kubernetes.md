## reliably scan kubernetes

Check for Reliably Suggestions for your Kubernetes resources

### Synopsis

Check your Kubernetes manifests for Reliably Suggestions.

Manifest(s) can be provided in several ways:
- read from standard input, with dash '-' as argument
- path to a single manifest file
- path to a folder that will be scanned recursively for manifests files

By default, the scan command, run without arguments, is scanning
manifests file from the current working directory.

Reliably can also scan for your live kubernetes cluster.

```
reliably scan kubernetes [path] [flags]
```

### Examples

```
# Scan a single file:
$ reliably scan kubernetes manifest.yaml

# Scan a folder:
$ reliably scan
$ reliably scan .
$ reliably scan ./manifests

# Scan with reading manifest from stdin:
$ cat manifest.yaml |Â reliably scan -

# Scan with custom format & output to local file
$ reliably scan --format json --output report.json

# Ignore specific rules
$ reliably scan kubernetes --ignore-rules K8S-POD-0002,K8S-DPL-0004

# Ignore rules defined in a .json file
$ reliably scan kubernetes --ignore-rules exceptions.json

# Scan a live Kubernetes cluster
$ reliably scan --live
$ reliably scan --live [--namespace n] [--kubecontext c] [--kubeconfig c]
```
