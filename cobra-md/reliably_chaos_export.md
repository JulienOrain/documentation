## reliably chaos export

chaos export command

### Synopsis

reliably chaos export provides the means to template out a Chaos Engineering experiment.

Currently, the command only supports Chaos Toolkit Experiments,
using SLOs within the Steady State Hypothesis.

Each SLO chosen is included as a probe, this probe checks whether the SLO
was met.

A control is also provided which will create entity-contexts regarding various
experiment objects (versions, runs, events, etc.) - this will be related to the
chosen SLOs.

The generated experiment relies on the chaostoolkit-reliably extension which
can be found here: https://github.com/chaostoolkit-incubator/chaostoolkit-reliably/.
