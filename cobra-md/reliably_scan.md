## reliably scan

Check for Reliably Suggestions

### Synopsis

Check your manifests for Reliably Suggestions.

Manifest(s) can be provided in several ways:
- read from standard input, with dash '-' as argument
- path to a single manifest file
- path to a folder that will be scanned recursively for manifests files

By default, the scan command, run without arguments, is scanning
manifests file from the current working directory.

Reliably can also scan for your live kubernetes cluster.

```
reliably scan [path] [flags]
```

### Examples

```
# Scan a single file:
$ reliably scan manifest.yaml

# Scan a folder:
$ reliably scan
$ reliably scan .
$ reliably scan ./manifests

# Scan with reading manifest from stdin:
$ cat manifest.yaml |Â reliably scan -

# Scan with custom format & output to local file
$ reliably scan --format json --output report.json

# Scan a live Kubernetes cluster
$ reliably scan --live
$ reliably scan --live [--namespace n] [--kubecontext c] [--kubeconfig c]
```
