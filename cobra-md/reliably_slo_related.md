## reliably slo related

fetches a node graph of relationships based on manifest objectives

### Synopsis

By defining the metadata.relatedTo keyword, arbitrary relationships
between 2 or more objectives/entities can be described. 

The [related] command uses the defined relationships to generate a 
Node Graph visualisation of the relationships defined in the local 
manifest and all entities within the organisation.

Passing the --raw/-r flag will return the raw JSON data used to draw
the graph. 

NOTE: the raw JSON data can also be retrieved by going to /data
when running the visualisation in a browser

```

open visualisation app on port 8085
$ reliably slo related -m reliably.yaml --port 8085

return raw JSON blob of visualisation data
$ reliably slo related --raw

open visualisation app on random port, only showing nodes with labels matching the given filters
$ reliably slo related --filter 'key=value' --filter 'key=value' -m reliably.yaml
```

### Options
